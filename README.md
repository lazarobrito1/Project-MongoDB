Project-MongoDB

In this project, .js scripts were created to insert, delete, update, and create a NoSQL database (MongoDB) using Node.js.
We set up a Node project (package.json), installed the MongoDB drivers in the project folder to establish a connection with the local database, and executed the scripts in the terminal using node "ScriptName.js".
